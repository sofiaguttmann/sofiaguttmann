Reminder: Prep assignments are to be completed individually. Upload a final copy of the .Qmd and renamed .pdf to your private repo, and submit the renamed pdf to Gradescope before the deadline (Sunday night, 3/3/24, by midnight).

# Reading

The associated reading for the week is Chapter 19 and Section 12.1. The topics are text as data and clustering. Each of these topics are potential topics that could be incorporated into your final (not shiny) projects. Clustering is explored further in Stat 240 (Multivariate Data Analysis), and we have a text analytics elective (Stat 325).

# 1 - Scraping Poems

For our first prep problem, we want to return to Lab 5a_Scraping, where we played around with scraping the poems of Emily Dickinson from Wikipedia pages. In the Lab folder, open scrape-poems.R, the provided R script for the Lab solution. We want to look at the script before we tackle the data in our next Lab, combining our scraping and text analysis skills. The goal here is to work to understand the script and how it is doing the scraping, as this may be useful for your projects (shiny and/or final projects).

Note: If you decide to run the script in its entirety yourself, the process will take a decent length of time (15-30 minutes). However, you don't need to (and don't have to) run the code to answer the questions that follow. Just look at it.

> part a - The plyr::ldply command is new. What do you learn about this function in the help menu?

Solution: This combines the results into a dataframe.

> part b - Why does the loop have tryCatch? What is this meant to do?

Solution: This catches errors instead of letting the code halt the running of the chunk. It can print a custom message or log the error.

> part c - What is reported as the poem text if an error occurs while the function is working through the loop?

Solution: It returns "Missing"

> part d - Finally, why is it important to end the file with a save_RDS command? I.E. how is this useful? (You can look up what the function does!)

Solution: It saves the object in a binary format to be able to access later. The file can be transferred easily and is especially useful for large datasets.

# 2 - Text as Data

```{r}
# set up text data provided
data(Macbeth_raw)

# str_split returns a list: we only want the first element
macbeth <- Macbeth_raw %>%
  str_split("\r\n") %>%
  pluck(1)
```

In Section 19.1.1, the `str_subset()`, `str_detect()`, and `str_which()` functions are introduced for detecting a pattern in a character vector (like finding a needle in a haystack). This section also introduces *regular expressions*.

> part a - Explain what the length values and 6 returned records tell us about what each function does below:

```{r}
length(str_subset(macbeth, "  MACBETH"))
str_subset(macbeth, "  MACBETH") %>% head()

length(str_which(macbeth, "  MACBETH"))
str_which(macbeth, "  MACBETH") %>% head()

length(str_detect(macbeth, "  MACBETH"))
str_detect(macbeth, "  MACBETH") %>% head()
```

Solution: There are 147 occurrences of "MACBETH' in 'macbeth' vector. The six records returned are lines from 'macbeth' where "MACBETH" occurs. 3194 is the number of elements in the character vector.

```{=html}
<!--
Yes, the textbook explains the differences, but it can be helpful if you run the lines yourself, as well, to be sure they work as you'd expect and to inspect the results.
-->
```
> part b - Why do the two lines below differ in their results?

```{r}
str_subset(macbeth, "MACBETH\\.") %>% head()

str_subset(macbeth, "MACBETH.") %>% head()
```

Solution: The first line only matches occurrences of "MACBETH" followed by a period. Second mathches occurrences of "MACBETH" with any character.

> part c - The three commands below look similar, but return different results. In words, explain what overall pattern is being searched for in each of the three cases (i.e., what do the patterns `MAC[B-Z]`, `MAC[B|Z]`, and `^MAC[B-Z]` indicate?)?

```{r}
str_subset(macbeth, "MAC[B-Z]") %>% head()

str_subset(macbeth,"MAC[B|Z]") %>% head()

str_subset(macbeth, "^MAC[B-Z]") %>% head()
```

Solution:

1.  This pattern matches occurrences of "MAC" followed by any character within the range from 'B' to 'Z'.
2.  This pattern matches occurrences of "MAC" followed by either 'B' or 'Z'.
3.  This pattern matches occurrences of "MAC" followed by any character within the range from 'B' to 'Z', but only if "MAC" appears at the beginning of a line.

> Optional - Explore these other patterns to figure out what they do.

```{r}
str_subset(macbeth, ".*MAC[B-Z]") %>% head()

str_subset(macbeth, ".MAC[B-Z]") %>% head()

str_subset(macbeth, "more$") %>% head()

# Code below should return character(0) (i.e., nothing)
str_subset(macbeth, "^MAC[B|Z]") %>% head()  
```

# 3 - K-means clustering

Section 12.1.2 walks through an example of how $k$-means clustering can identify genuine patterns in data---in this case, clustering cities into continental groups merely based on city location (longitude and latitude coordinates). The textbook code is modified below to parse out some of the steps for using the `kmeans()` function of the **mclust** package and to add the centroid locations to a reproduction of Figure 12.4. The data for this example comes from the **mdsr** package.

> part a - Run the code below to implement the k-means algorithm. Take a look at the resulting output for each object in the code chunk in some way (print in the console, `glimpse()`, or `head()`).

```{=html}
<!--
Note: The $k$-means clustering algorithm starts by choosing $k$ points at random as initial guesses of where the cluster centroids might be. The `nstart` option specifies how many different configurations of initial guesses we want the algorithm to try, and the algorithm reports the results from the best initial configuration. It is generally recommended to specify `nstart` with a large value (e.g., 20 or 50). 
-->
```
Solution:

<!-- Your solution will add the appropriate commands to look at the output, unless you just looked via the console. -->

```{r}
data(world_cities)

# Identify the 4,000 biggest cities in the world
big_cities <- world_cities %>%
  arrange(desc(population)) %>%
  head(4000) %>%
  select(longitude, latitude)

# Make sure to set seed for reproducibility!
set.seed(15)
city_kmeans_results <- big_cities %>% 
  kmeans(centers = 6, nstart = 30) 
```

> part b - The code below reports on the class of the `city_kmeans_results` and the named elements we can refer to and select from that class. What type of object is `city_kmeans_results`? What named elements does the object contain and what information does each element give us?

Hint: the **Value** section of the help documentation will help you understand what each named element is.

```{r}
# Check object class or type
class(city_kmeans_results)

# Check named elements of object
names(city_kmeans_results)
```

Solution:These elements provide valuable information about the results of the K-means clustering algorithm, including the cluster assignments, centroid coordinates, and measures of the overall clustering quality.

> part c - Where are the estimated centroids of the 6 clusters? How many cities were assigned to the first cluster? Which cluster contains the most cities?

```{r}
# Centroids
city_kmeans_results$centers

# Cluster sizes
city_kmeans_results$size
```

Solution:

```         
726 554 984 392 356 988
```

> part d - Run the code below to create a plot of the assigned clusters. What do you think Cluster 2 represents?

```{r}
# Join cluster assignments with original dataset
big_cities <- big_cities %>% 
  add_column(cluster = factor(city_kmeans_results$cluster))

# Make dataframe out of estimated cluster centroids
city_cluster_centers <- city_kmeans_results$centers %>%
  data.frame() %>% 
  add_column(cluster_number = 1:6)

# Plot cluster assignments and centroids
ggplot(big_cities, aes(x = longitude, y = latitude)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = cluster), alpha = 0.6)  + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Spectral") +
  geom_label(data = city_cluster_centers, 
             aes(label = cluster_number), 
             size = 3) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

Solution:

> part e - In $k$-means clustering, the analyst specifies the number of clusters to create. Reproduce the k-means analysis above but update the `center` argument within the `kmeans()` function to identify 3 clusters instead of 6. (Show the code for this - copy/paste/edit as needed.) Then, create a plot like the one above, but coloring the points by these new cluster assignments. How many cities are in Cluster 1 now? What does Cluster 2 represent now?

Solution:

```{r}
# be sure to set a seed for reproducibility before k-means runs
```
